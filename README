Hotkeys for me :)

Win-Q = Terminal
Win-W = Web browser
Win-E = Editor


Pressing the hotkey will focus on the application window:
- if the application is running it is made the focused one by raising it
- otherwise the application is started

When there is more matching windows, a menu is displayed to choose from.
